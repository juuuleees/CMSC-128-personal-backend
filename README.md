Node app that serves as a getter from database.

Requirements:
-Node v.11.x.x+
-MariaDB (change the database configuration in controllers/resto-controller.js)

Steps:
-import all the sql entries in DB entries folder (tried and tested. May error sa comma yung original 'input_1-25.sql' sa database section);
-run npm install to get the required node modules(for now)
-run 'node app.js' to test the app. (Default address entry is 'localhost:6969')

This can base as skeleton for the latter parts of the backend work. Do add more functionalities as needed.# CMSC-128-personal-backend
